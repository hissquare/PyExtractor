This file is not a virus or malware its just a compiled version of [pycdc/Decompyle++](https://github.com/zrax/pycdc)

was originally thinking of making my own decompiler/disassembler but that would prob drain my sanity, if you dont trust this file then go to https://github.com/zrax/pycdc and download the repo and compile the source, then drag the pycdc.exe generated in here
